# neo4j puppet module

# DEPRECATED

This module is no longer supported by **amosjwood**. It is now maintained by **mlambrichs**.

I developed this for my team at work to do Neo4j support, but we don't use it anymore and I don't want it to go stale.
So, I am handing off support to mlambrichs who graciously wanted to take ownership of it and continue development. **Many thanks to mlambrichs**.

From now on, all support, issues, and updates will be located at the new forge module of
